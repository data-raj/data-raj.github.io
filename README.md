# My Deep Learning Projects.

This is the repository Which contains a few deep learning projects which I have worked upon.
I will keep on updating it.


Projects covered so far.

1. Facial Key points Detection
2. Image Captions Generation using CNN-RNN Encoder

# 1. Facial Key points Detection

This project involves combining the knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning to build and end-to-end facial key-points recognition system. Facial key-points include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on any face and are used in many applications, from facial tracking to emotion recognition.

This model will be able to take in any image containing faces and identify the location of each face and their facial key-points.

The project will be broken up into a few main parts in one Python notebook:

Part 1 : Investigating OpenCV, pre-processing, and face detection

Part 2 : Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect facial keypoints

Part 3 : Putting parts 1 and 2 together to identify facial key-points on any image

# 2. Image Captions Generation using CNN-RNN Encoder

Image captioning : We will create a deep learning model with two components: a CNN that transforms an input image into a set of features, and an RNN that turns those features into rich, descriptive language.

In this project, We will focus on the part of the model that can generate descriptive sentences for each Image
